# Those other things that are good to know

- `==` tests "value equality"
- `is` tests "identity equality"

## The Python Execution Model

- `def` is actually a statement
    - when executed in sequence with other top-level model scope code, causes code within function to be bound to name of function
- top-level functions are defined when a module is imported or run
    - when modules are imported or run, all top-level statements are run, which is what results in function(s) within module namespace being defined

### Module, Script, or Program
- **Python module**: convenient import with API
- **Python script**: convenient execution from from command line
- **Python program**: perhaps composed of many modules(?)

It is _**strongly**_ suggested that scripts are importable as modules and that modules can be executable.

For this reason, most modules adhere to form of defining one or more importable functions, followed by a postscript to facilitate execution as a script

## Command Line Arguments

```python
import sys
from urllib.request import urlopen

# 'http://sixty-north.com/c/t.txt'


def fetch_words(url):
    story = urlopen(url)
    story_words = []

    for line in story:
        line_words = line.decode('utf8').split()
        for word in line_words:
            story_words.append(word)
    story.close()
    return story_words


def print_items(items):
    for item in items:
        print(item)


def main(url):
    words = fetch_words(url)
    print_items(words)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main(sys.argv[1])

```

- more `import` examples
```py
# importing multiple objects from module
from cli_args_words import (fetch_words, print_words)

# import everything from module
from cli_args_words import *
```

- access of command-line arguments through attribute of `sys` module called `argv` (a list of strings)
- after first refactor, can run from shell with:
```bash
$ python /_demos/story_words/cli_args_words.py http://sixty-north.com/c/t.txt
```
- however, can no longer be run from REPL env, since `url` in `main()` is unlikely to get any value from `sys.argv[1]`
- 2nd refactor fixes this issue to make `main()` accept the `url` param

- Additional inspiration:
    - arg parse module
    - doc opt module (third-party)

## Docstrings
- literal strings which document functions, modules, and classes
- must be FIRST statement in blocks for these constructs

- convention for docstrings is documented in PEP257, though not widely adopted
- **Sphinx**: tool for creating HTML documentation from Python docstrings
- form from Google's Python Style Guide is used in this course


## Shebang

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env python
```

- mark script as executable
```bash
$ chmod +x /path/to/script.py
```
