# Strings and Representations

## `repr()`

- built-in function
- produces unambiguous string representation of an object
- often suggested that `repr()` should return legitimate source code (i.e. can be copy/pasted and run to recreate the object)

```python
class Point2D:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __str__(self):
        return '({}, {})'.format(self.x, self.y)

    def __repr__(self):
        return 'Point2D(x={}, y={})'.format(self.x, self.y)

point = Point2D(x=12, y=24)
point.repr()
#=> 'Point2D(x=12, y=24)'
str(point)
#=> '(12, 24)'
```

### Other considerations

- exactness more important than human-friendliness
- suited for debugging
- includes identifying information
- generally best for logging
- generally, result of `repr()` should contain **more information** than result of `str()`
- as a rule, should **always write** a `repr()` for your classes

## `str()`

- built-in function
- produces readable, human-friendly representation of an object
- used in situations where it might be integrated into normal text or where programming-level details might be meaningless

## `repr()` and `str()` details

- by default, `str()` calls `repr()`
    - _i.e. if `__str__` is not defined on a class but `__repr__` is, then `__repr__` will be called when `str()` is called on an instance of that class_
- however, `repr()` _does not_ call `str()`
- `repr()` is used when showing elements of a collection

## Interaction with `format()`

- `__format__()` is special class method which is invoked by `str.format()`
- simple example
```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, foo, bar):
        self.foo = foo
        self.bar = bar

    def __format__(self, f): # `f` contains any special formatting options specified in original format string
        return '[Formatted representation of class: {}, {}, {}]'.format(self.foo, self.bar, f)
```
- can force the use of a class's methods:
    - force use of `__repr__()` by using `!r` in the format string: `'{!r}.format()`
    - force use of `__str__()` by using `!s` in the format string: `'{!s}.format()`

## `reprlib`

- standard library module
- supports alternative implementations of `repr()`
- often used for things like limiting how many elements of a large list is printed
- primary usage is simply `reprlib.repr()`
- [reprlib docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/reprlib.html)

## Other built-in functions

- `ascii()`
    - takes string as argument and replaces non-ASCII characters with escape sequences
- `ord()`
    - takes single character string and converts it to **integer** Unicode codepoint
- `chr()`
    - takes single **integer** Unicode codepoint and converts it to single character string
