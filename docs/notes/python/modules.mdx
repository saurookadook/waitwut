# Modules

- reusable functions
- source code files called modules
- modules can be used from other modules
    - _as long as circular dependencies aren't introduced by doing so_
- importing modules
- modules can be executed directly as programs or scripts
- Python execution model
    - to help understand when code is evaluated and executed
- make programs executable
    - using command line arguments to get basic config data into program
- simplest way to run Python scripts from shell:
```bash
$ python /path/to/file/script.py
```

## Executable Directories

```
reader
 |__  __main__.py  <- This file will handle the execution
 |__  reader
       |__  __init__.py
       |__  compressed
       |     |__  __init__.py
       |     |__  bzipped.py
       |     |__  gzipped.py
       |__  reader.py
```

## Modules as Singletons

```python
# registry.py
_registry = []

def register(name):
    _registry.append(name)

def registered_names():
    return iter(_registry)



# use_registry.py
import registry

registry.register('my name')
for name in registry.registered_names():
    print(name)


```
