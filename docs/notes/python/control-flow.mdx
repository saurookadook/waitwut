# Control Flow

- [Conditional Statements](#conditional-statements)
- [Loops](#loops)

## Conditional Statements

### `if`
- branch execution based on value of expression
- expression used in `if` statement will be converted to a boolean as if `bool()` constructor had been used
- basic syntax:
```py
if expression:
    block # block is terminated by blank line


if True:
    print("It's true!")

#=> It's true!
```

### `else` clause
```py
h = 42
if h > 50:
    print("Greater than 50")
else:
    print("50 or smaller")

#=> 50 or smaller
```

### `elif` clause
```py
h = 42
if h > 50:
    print("Greater than 50")
elif h < 20:
    print("Less than 20")
else:
    print("Between 20 and 50")

#=> Between 20 and 50
```

## Loops

### `while` Loop
- similarly as in `if` statements, passed expression is implicitly converted to boolean
- basic syntax:
```py
while expression:
    block # block is terminated by blank line


c = 5
while c != 0:
    print(c)
    c -= 1 # augmented assignment operator

#=> 5
#=> 4
#=> 3
#=> 2
#=> 1

# because `c` will eventually equal 0, can replace above example with:
c = 5
while c:
    print(c)
    c -= 1

# however, this is probably not preferable because "explicit is better than implicit"
```

### `break` keyword
- many languages support loop construct ending in predicate test
- C, C++, C#, Java, Ruby, and others have `do-while`
- other languages have "repeat until" loops instead
- NOTE: does not exist in Python; idiom is to use `while True` and `break` (using `break` to facilitate early exit)
    - `break` jumps out of inner-most executing loop to line immediately after it
- basic usage:
```py
while True:
    response = input() # built-in `input` function used to request string from user
    if int(response) % 7 == 0:
        break


```
