# Basic example from Linux Installation

```bash
$ pip list

$ pip install <package_name>

$ pip uninstall <package_name>

$ pip install -U <package_name> # upgrades given package(s)

```

## Where Are Packages Installed?

- the `sys.path` variable
- installing for other Python versions

```bash
$ python3
Python 3.9.12 (main, May  8 2022, 18:05:47)
[Clang 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
```
```python
>>> import sys
>>> sys.path
['', '/usr/local/Cellar/python@3.9/3.9.12_1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.9/lib/python39.zip', '/usr/local/Cellar/python@3.9/3.9.12_1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.9/lib/python3.9', '/usr/local/Cellar/python@3.9/3.9.12_1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.9/lib/python3.9/lib-dynload', '/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages']
>>>
```

- directories that Python Interpreter searches to find module trying to be imported

```bash
$ pip3 show wheel
Name: wheel
Version: 0.37.1

## A Better Way to Call pip

```bash
$ python -m pip
```

## User and system installs

`pip` tries to:
- install package in system-wide location
- only if that is not allowed, it will try to install for user specifically

To install package for user only:
```bash
python -m pip install --user babel
```

## Getting Package Information with pip

```bash
python -m pip help <command>
```

Packages downloaded from [PyPI (Python Package Index)](https://pypi.org/)
- site also called the "Cheese Shop", after a famous sketch from Monty Python and because downloaded packages are in format called a "wheel" (like a wheel of cheese)
