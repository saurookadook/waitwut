# [What is an Algorithm?](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/algorithm)

-   set of well-defined instructions to solve particular problem
-   takes set of input and produces desired output

## Qualities of Good Algorithms

-   input and output should be defined precisely
-   east step in algorithm should be clear and unambiguous
-   should be most effective among many different ways to solve problem
-   algorithm shouldn't include "computer code" (i.e. algorithm should be written in such a way that it can be used in
    different programming languages)

# [Data Structures and Types](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/data-structure-types)

## What are Data Structures?

-   storage device/technique used to store and organize data
-   way of arranging data on computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently

## Types of Data Structure

-   Linear data structure
-   Non-linear data structure

## Linear Data Structures

-   elements arranged in sequence one after the other

## Popular linear data structures

### Array Data Structure

-   elements in memory arranged in continuous memory
-   all elements are of the same type (usually)
-   type of element that can be stored in form of arrays is determined by programming language
-   [Java Array](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/arrays)

### Stack Data Structure

-   elements stored according to LIFO principle
-   [Stack Data Structure](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/stack)

### Queue Data Structure

-   elements stored according to FIFO principle
-   [Queue Data Structure](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/queue)

### Linked List Data Structure

-   data elements connected through series of nodes
-   each node contains data items and address to next node
-   [Linked List Data Structure](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/linked-list)

## Non-linear Data Structures

-   elements not stored in any sequence
-   arranged in hierarchical manner where one element connected to one or more elements

### Graph Data Structure

-   each node is called vertex
-   each vertex is connected to other vertices through edges
-   [Graph Data Structure](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/graph)

## Linear Vs Non-linear Data Structures

| Linear Data Structures                                                                                                                            | Non Linear Data Structures                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The data items are arranged in sequential order, one after the other.                                                                             | The data items are arranged in non-sequential order (hierarchical manner).                                                                     |
| All the items are present on the single layer.                                                                                                    | The data items are present at different layers.                                                                                                |
| It can be traversed on a single run. That is, if we start from the first element, we can traverse all the elements sequentially in a single pass. | It requires multiple runs. That is, if we start from the first element it might not be possible to traverse all the elements in a single pass. |
| The memory utilization is not efficient.                                                                                                          | Different structures utilize memory in different efficient ways depending on the need.                                                         |
| The time complexity increase with the data size.                                                                                                  | Time complexity remains the same.                                                                                                              |
| Example: Arrays, Stack, Queue                                                                                                                     | Example: Tree, Graph, Map                                                                                                                      |

# [Asymptotic Analysis](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/asymptotic-notations)

## Asymptotic Notations

-   mathematical notations used to describe the running time of an algorithm where input tends towards a particular
    value or a limiting value

## Big-O Notation (O-notation)

-   represents upper bound of running time of algorithm (the worst-case complexity)

## Omega Notation (Ω-notation)

-   represents lower bound of running time of algorithm (the best-case complexity)

## Theta Notation (Θ-notation)

-   encloses function from above and below (the average-case complexity)

# [Divide and Conquer Algorithm](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/divide-and-conquer)

**divide and conquer algorithm** is strategy of using **recursion** to solve a large problem by

1. breaking the problem into smaller sub-problems
2. solving sub-problems
3. combining them to get desired output

[Recursion in Java](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/recursion)

## How do Divide and Conquer Algorithms Work?

1. **Divide:** divide given problem into sub-problems using recursion
2. **Conquer:** solve smaller sub-problems recursively, and if sub-problem is small enough, solve it directly
3. **Combine:** combine solutions of sub-problems which are part of recursive process to solve actual problem

Example: [merge sort](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/merge-sort)

## Divide and Conquer Vs. Dynamic Approach

Divide and Conquer

-   result of each sub-problem is not stored for future reference
-   used when same sub-problem is not solved multiple times

Dynamic Approach

-   result of each sub-problem _is_ stored for future reference
-   used when result of sub-problem is to be used multiple times in future

## Advantages of Divide and Conquer Algorithm

-   lower overall complexity?
-   suitable for multi-processing systems
-   makes efficient use of memory caches

## Divide and Conquer Applications

-   [Merge Sort](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/merge-sort)
-   [Quick Sort](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/quick-sort)
