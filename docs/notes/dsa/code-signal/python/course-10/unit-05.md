## Topic Overview and Actualization

Sometimes referred to as **hash maps** in various programming languages, **hash tables** play an instrumental role in providing a practical and efficient means of organizing data.

**Hash tables** drive many data storage techniques and in-memory databases, powering large-scale applications such as database indexing, caches, and even some machine learning algorithms. They store data associatively, linking or mapping values to unique keys.

This lesson focuses on understanding the underlying structure and mechanics of **hash tables**, how they handle conflicts or collisions when multiple keys hash to the same index, and how to perform complexity analysis to understand their efficiency. By the end of this lesson, you should understand how **hash tables** operate and how Python dictionaries leverage the principles of **hash tables**.

## Understanding Hash Tables

As we delve into the world of **hash tables**, let's start by understanding their underlying structure. A **hash table** consists of **an array** _(the actual table where data is stored)_, coupled with **a hash function**. The **hash function** plays a crucial role - it takes the keys as input and generates an index, mapping keys to different slots or indices in the table.

Each index of the **array** holds a bucket that ultimately contains the key-value pair. The pairing of keys with values enhances the data retrieval process. The efficiency of retrieving values depends on the **hash function's** ability to distribute data across the array uniformly.

You can also think of **hash tables** as 'hash sets storing tuples of `(key, value)`', but this particular interface makes it less easy to use, so Python has a concept of dictionaries we will cover below.

Let's visualize this with a Python dictionary, which operates on the same principle. Suppose we have a dictionary containing student names as keys and their corresponding scores as values:

```python
# A simple dictionary illustrating the principle of hashing
student_scores = { 'Tom': 85, 'Serena': 92, 'Alex': 78, 'Nina': 88 }

# printing the scores
for student, score in student_scores.items():
    print(f"{student}: {score}")

# Outputs:
# Tom: 85
# Serena: 92
# Alex: 78
# Nina: 88
```

In this example, `'Tom'`, `'Serena'`, `'Alex'`, and `'Nina'` are keys, while `85`, `92`, `78`, and `88` are their associated values. Under the hood, the Python interpreter uses a hash function to assign each key-value pair to a unique address in memory.

## Collision Handling in Hash Tables

There are instances when two different keys produce the same index after being processed through the **hash function**. This situation is known as a collision. When a collision occurs, we are faced with a dilemma - where do we store the new key-value pair since that index is already occupied?

Here are two common strategies to handle such scenarios:

1. **Chaining**: In this method, each index _(or `bucket`)_ in the **array** hosts a linked list of all key-value pairs that hash to the same index. When a collision occurs, we simply go to the collided index and append the new key-value pair to the existing linked list.

2. **Open Addressing**: Upon encountering a collision, the **hash table** searches for another free slot or index in the table _(possibly the next available empty slot)_ and assigns that location to the new key-value pair. This approach requires a suitable probing strategy to ensure efficient use of table space.

The image below provides a visual example of **Chaining** collision resolving method - `John Smith` and `Sandra Dee` have the same **hash function** result, so their entries are organized in a linked list in the corresponding bucket.

## Time and Space Complexity Analysis for Hash Tables

**Hash tables** are renowned for their efficiency and speed when it comes to data storage and retrieval. They boast constant time complexity **`O(1)`** for the operations on key-value pairs - insertion, deletion, and retrieval. This efficiency comes from a good **hash function**, which allows for keys to be uniformly distributed across the table and accessed directly via their indices, eliminating the need to scan through unnecessary slots.

Although **hash tables** generally perform robustly, situations may arise where frequent collisions occur. Such situations could deteriorate the table's efficiency and extend the time complexity to a worst-case scenario of **`O(n)`**, where `n` is the number of keys hashing to the same index.

## Working with Hash Tables in Python â€“ Dictionaries

Python provides a built-in implementation of **hash tables**, known as **dictionaries**. **Dictionaries** in Python work similarly to **hash tables**. They allow the use of arbitrary keys to access values and handle collisions seamlessly behind the scenes, ensuring consistent and quick access to stored data.

You can create a **dictionary** with key-value pairs, access values using keys, and perform various operations such as adding new key-value pairs and deleting them, as demonstrated below:

```python
# Create a Python dictionary similar to a Hash Table
book_ratings = {
    "Moby-Dick": 8,
    "The Great Gatsby": 9,
    "War and Peace": 10,
    "The Catcher in the Rye": 8
}

# Access a value with its key. This happens in O(1) time
print(book_ratings["Moby-Dick"])   # Outputs: 8
# Another way to access a value with its key is by providing the default value if the key is not there. Complexity is also O(1).
print(book_ratings.get("Moby-Dick", 0)) # Outputs: 8
print(book_ratings.get("Moby Dick", 0)) # Outputs: 0

# Add a new key-value pair. The addition operation is also O(1)
book_ratings["To Kill a Mockingbird"] = 9
book_ratings["The Great Gatsby"] = 8
print(book_ratings)
# Outputs: {"Moby-Dick": 8, "The Great Gatsby": 8, "War and Peace": 10, "The Catcher in the Rye": 8, "To Kill a Mockingbird": 9}

# Remove a key-value pair. Deletion is also a constant time operation
del book_ratings["War and Peace"]
print(book_ratings)
# Outputs: {"Moby-Dick": 8, "The Great Gatsby": 9, "The Catcher in the Rye": 8, "To Kill a Mockingbird": 9}
```
