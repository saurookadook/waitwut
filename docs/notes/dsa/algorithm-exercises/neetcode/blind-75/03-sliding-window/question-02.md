## Instructions

Given a string `s`, find the _length of the longest substring_ without duplicate characters.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

```

Explanation: The string "xyz" is the longest without duplicate characters.

**Example 2**:

```java
Input: s = "xxxx"

Output: 1
```

**Constraints**:

- `0 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s` may consist of printable ASCII characters.
