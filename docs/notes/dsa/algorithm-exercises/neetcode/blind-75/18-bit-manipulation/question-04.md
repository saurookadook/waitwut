## Instructions

Given an array `nums` containing `n` integers in the range `[0, n]` without any duplicates, return the single number in the range that is missing from `nums`.

**Follow-up**: Could you implement a solution using only `O(1)` extra space complexity and `O(n)` runtime complexity?

**Example 1**:

```Java
Input: nums = [1,2,3]

Output: 0
```

Explanation: Since there are `3` numbers, the range is `[0,3]`. The missing number is `0` since it does not appear in `nums`.

**Example 2**:

```Java
Input: nums = [0,2]

Output: 1
```

**Constraints**:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
