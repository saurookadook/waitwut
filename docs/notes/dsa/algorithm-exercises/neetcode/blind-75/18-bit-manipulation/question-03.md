## Instructions

Given a 32-bit unsigned integer `n`, reverse the bits of the binary representation of `n` and return the result.

**Example 1**:

```Java
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000010101

Output:    2818572288 (10101000000000000000000000000000)
```

Explanation: Reversing `00000000000000000000000000010101`, which represents the unsigned integer `21`, gives us `10101000000000000000000000000000` which represents the unsigned integer `2818572288`.
