## Instructions

You are given an unsigned integer `n`. Return the number of `1` bits in its binary representation.

You may assume `n` is a non-negative integer which fits within 32-bits.

**Example 1**:

```Java
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000010111

Output: 4
```

**Example 2**:

```Java
Input: n = 01111111111111111111111111111101
