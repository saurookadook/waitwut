## Instructions

Given a string `s`, return the longest substring of `s` that is a _palindrome_.

A **palindrome** is a string that reads the same forward and backward.

If there are multiple palindromic substrings that have the same length, return any one of them.

**Example 1**:

```java
Input: s = "ababd"

Output: "bab"
```

Explanation: Both "aba" and "bab" are valid answers.

**Example 2**:

```java
Input: s = "abbc"

Output: "bb"
```

**Constraints**:

- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s` contains only digits and English letters.
