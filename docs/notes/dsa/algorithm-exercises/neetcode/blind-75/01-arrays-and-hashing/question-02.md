## Instructions

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if the two strings are anagrams of each other, otherwise return `false`.

An **anagram** is a string that contains the exact same characters as another string, but the order of the characters can be different.

**Example 1**:

```java
Input: s = "racecar", t = "carrace"

Output: true
```

**Example 2**:

```java
Input: s = "jar", t = "jam"

Output: false
```

**Constraints**:

- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.
