## Instructions

Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a single string. The encoded string is then decoded back to the original list of strings.

Please implement `encode` and `decode`

**Example 1**:

```Java
Input: ["neet","code","love","you"]

Output:["neet","code","love","you"]
```

**Example 2**:

```Java
Input: ["we","say",":","yes"]

Output: ["we","say",":","yes"]
```

**Constraints**:

- `0 <= strs.length < 100`
- `0 <= strs[i].length < 200`
- `strs[i]` contains only UTF-8 characters.
