Planning steps:
- domain model
- code design

### Quotes

### Introduction

> Software has to be practical and useful; otherwise we would not invest so much time and resources into its creation. That makes it extremely connected to a certain aspect of our lives. A useful package of software cannot be decoupled from that sphere of reality, the domain it is supposed to help us manage. On the contrary, the software is deeply entangled with it.
_pg. 1_

#### Ch. 1: What Is Domain-Driven Design

> When we begin a software project, we should focus on the domain it is operating in. The entire purpose of the software is to enhance a specific domain.
> ...
> How can we make the software fit harmoniously with the domain? The best way to do it is to make software a reflection of the domain. Software needs to incorporate the core concepts and elements of the domain, and to precisely realize the relationships between them. Software has to model the domain.
> Somebody without knowledge of banking should be able to learn a lot just by reading the code in a domain model. This is essential.
_pg. 4_

> According to Eric Evans, a domain model is not a particular diagram; it is the idea that the diagram is intended to convey. It is not just the knowledge in a domain expert's head; it is a rigorously organized and selective abstraction of that knowledge. A diagram can represent and communicate a model, as can carefully written code, as can an English sentence.
> ...
> We need to organize information, to systematize it, to divide it up in smaller pieces, to group those pieces into logical modules, and take one at a time and deal with it. We even need to leave some parts of the domain out. A domain contains just too much information to include it all into the model. And much of it is not even necessary to be considered.
_pg. 5_

> We are not alone in this process, so we need to share knowledge and information, and we need to do it well, precisely, completely, and without ambiguity.
_pg. 6_

##### Building Domain Knowledge

> You and the domain experts are talking, you are exchanging knowledge. You start asking questions, and they respond. While they do that, they dig essential concepts out of the air traffic domain. Those concepts may come out unpolished and disorganized, but nonetheless they are essential for understanding the domain. You need to learn as much as possible about the domain from the experts. And by putting the right questions, and processing the information in the right way, you and the experts will start to sketch a view of the domain, a domain model.
_pg. 11_

#### Ch. 2: The Ubiquitous Language
