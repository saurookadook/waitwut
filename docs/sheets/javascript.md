## Ponyfill

_from [ponyfill](https://ponyfill.com)_

> A [polyfill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill_(programming)) is code that adds missing functionality by [monkey patching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch) an API. Unfortunately, it usually globally patches built-ins, which affects all code running in the environment. This is especially problematic when a polyfill is not fully spec compliant (which in some cases is impossible), as it could cause very hard to debug bugs and inconsistencies. Or when the spec for a new feature changes and your code depends on behavior that a module somewhere else in the dependency tree polyfills differently. In general, [you should not modify API's you don't own](https://www.nczonline.net/blog/2010/03/02/maintainable-javascript-dont-modify-objects-you-down-own/).
>
> A ponyfill, in contrast, doesn't monkey patch anything, but instead exports the functionality as a normal module, so you can use it locally without affecting other code.
>
> tl;dr: Polyfills are naughty as they patch native APIs, while ponyfills are pure and don't affect the environment.
>

> ```JavaScript
> Number.isNaN ??= function (value) {
> 	return value !== value;
> };
> ```
>
> ```JavaScript
> import 'is-nan-polyfill';
>
> Number.isNaN(5);
> ```
>
> **Ponyfill**
>
> ```JavaScript
> export default function isNaN(value) {
> 	return value !== value;
> };
> ```
>
> ```JavaScript
> import isNanPonyfill from 'is-nan-ponyfill';
>
> isNanPonyfill(5);
> ```
>
> Ponyfills should avoid using native APIs, because potential bugs or differences in the native APIs will make such a ponyfill less robust (therefore defeating one of its main purposes). There are important exceptions, such as when:
> - There is no way to implement some of the ponyfill without native APIs.
> - Reimplementing native parts would have a large cost (e.g. performance or code size).
> In such cases, it's still valuable for the ponyfill to minimize any assumptions about the underlying environment.

## Debouncing

A technique to ensure that event handler is only called after event has stopped firing for a certain amount of time.

Simple example from [Optimizing window.onresize](https://bencentra.com/code/2015/02/27/optimizing-window-resize.html)

```JavaScript
var w = document.querySelector("#width");
var h = document.querySelector("#height");
var c = document.querySelector("#calls");
var timeout = null;
var delay = 250; // delay after event is "complete" to run callback
var calls = 0;

// window.resize callback function
function getDimensions() {
  w.innerHTML = window.innerWidth;
  h.innerHTML = window.innerHeight;
  calls += 1;
  c.innerHTML = calls;
}

// window.resize event listener
window.addEventListener('resize', function() {
  // clear the timeout
  clearTimeout(timeout);
  // start timing for event "completion"
  timeout = setTimeout(getDimensions, delay);
});

getDimensions();

```

## Asynchronous Stuff

_TODO_ ðŸ™ƒ

## IIFE

```JavaScript
const colors = []

(function() {
    if (!dontAddColors) {
        colors.push('green', 'blue', 'red');
    }
})();

if (colors.length) {
    console.log('Look at these colors! ', colors);
} else {
    console.log('No colors to print :(');
}
```

## lolwtf

```JavaScript
console.log(true - false); // 1
console.log(false - false); // -0
```

## Node.js

### Running a file with debugger enabled

```javascript
// some/path/to/index.js
function doTheThing() {
    debugger;
    console.log('Doing the thing!');
}


// NOTE: depending on file passed to `node inspect` command, might have to execute the function directly
doTheThing();

module.exports = doTheThing
```

```sh
$ node inspect some/path/to/index.js
```
