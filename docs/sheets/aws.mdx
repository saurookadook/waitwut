## Benefits
_...of cloud computing_

1. High Availability
    - systems designed to operate continuously without failure for long time
    - avoid loss of service by managing or reducing errors
2. Elasticity
    - provision what you need, then shrink/grow based on demand
3. Agility
    - cloud services help innovate faster
4. Durability
    - long-term data protection

## Compute Services

### EC2

#### Pricing Options
- On-Demand
- Spot
- Reserved Instances
- Dedicated Hosts
- Savings Plans

#### Features
- **Elastic Load Balancing**: automatically distributes incoming app traffic across multiple EC2 instances
- **EC2 Auto Scaling**: adds or replaces EC2 instances automatically across AZs _(based on need and changing demand)_
    - _**NOTE** that this is horizontal scaling and **not** vertical scaling_

##### Additional Resources

- [Amazon EC2 FAQs](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/)
- [Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling FAQs](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/autoscaling/faqs/)

### Lambda

- [Lambda Sample Code](https://github.com/linuxacademy/content-aws-certified-cloud-practioner/blob/main/lessons/exploring-compute-services-lambda/index.js)

#### Pricing Model

Charged based on **duration** and **number of requests**

1. Compute time
    - pay only for compute time used
    - no charge if code is not running
    - duration calculated from `time code begins running` to `time code returns or terminates`
2. Request count
    - request is counted each time execution starts
    - **NOTE**: tests invoked in the console count as well
3. Always free
    - includes 1 million free requests each month

### Additional Services

#### Containers

- [Containers at AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/containers/)
- [Amazon Elastic Container Service FAQs](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/faqs/)
- [Amazon EKS FAQs](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/faqs/)
- [AWS Fargate FAQs](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/faqs/)

- **Fargate**
    - serverless compute engine for containers
    - allows you to manage containers, like Docker
    - scales automatically
    - serverless === no worrying about provisioning, configuring, or scaling servers
- **Amazon Lightsail**
    - allows for quickly launching all necessary resources for small projects
    - deploy preconfigured applications _(like Wordpress site)_ with click of button
    - simple screens for people with no cloud experience
    - includes virtual machine, SSD-based storage, data transfer, DNS management, and static IP
    - low, predictable monthly fee _(as low as $3.50)_
- **AWS Outposts**
    - allows for running cloud services in internal data centers
    - supports workloads that need to remain on-premises _(due to latency or data sovereignty needs)_
    - AWS delivers and installs servers in your internal data center
    - used for hybrid experience
    - have access to cloud services and APIs to develop apps on-premises
- **AWS Batch**
    - allows for processing large workloads in smaller chunks _(or batches)_
    - runs hundreds and thousands of smaller batch processing jobs
    - dynamically provisions instances based on volume
