## Benefits
_...of cloud computing_

1. High Availability
    - systems designed to operate continuously without failure for long time
    - avoid loss of service by managing or reducing errors
2. Elasticity
    - provision what you need, then shrink/grow based on demand
3. Agility
    - cloud services help innovate faster
4. Durability
    - long-term data protection

## Compute Services

### EC2

#### Pricing Options
- On-Demand
- Spot
- Reserved Instances
- Dedicated Hosts
- Savings Plans

#### Features
- **Elastic Load Balancing**: automatically distributes incoming app traffic across multiple EC2 instances
- **EC2 Auto Scaling**: adds or replaces EC2 instances automatically across AZs _(based on need and changing demand)_
    - _**NOTE** that this is horizontal scaling and **not** vertical scaling_

##### Additional Resources

- [Elastic Load Balancing Features](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/features/)
- [Amazon EC2 FAQs](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/)
- [Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling FAQs](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/autoscaling/faqs/)

### Lambda

- [Lambda Sample Code](https://github.com/linuxacademy/content-aws-certified-cloud-practioner/blob/main/lessons/exploring-compute-services-lambda/index.js)

#### Pricing Model

Charged based on **duration** and **number of requests**

1. Compute time
    - pay only for compute time used
    - no charge if code is not running
    - duration calculated from `time code begins running` to `time code returns or terminates`
2. Request count
    - request is counted each time execution starts
    - **NOTE**: tests invoked in the console count as well
3. Always free
    - includes 1 million free requests each month

### Additional Services

#### Containers

- [Amazon Elastic Container Service FAQs](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/faqs/)
- [Amazon EKS FAQs](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/faqs/)
- [AWS Fargate FAQs](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/faqs/)

- **Fargate**
    - serverless compute engine for containers
    - allows you to manage containers, like Docker
    - scales automatically
    - serverless === no worrying about provisioning, configuring, or scaling servers
- **Amazon Lightsail**
    - allows for quickly launching all necessary resources for small projects
    - deploy preconfigured applications _(like Wordpress site)_ with click of button
    - simple screens for people with no cloud experience
    - includes virtual machine, SSD-based storage, data transfer, DNS management, and static IP
    - low, predictable monthly fee _(as low as $3.50)_
- **AWS Outposts**
    - allows for running cloud services in internal data centers
    - supports workloads that need to remain on-premises _(due to latency or data sovereignty needs)_
    - AWS delivers and installs servers in your internal data center
    - used for hybrid experience
    - have access to cloud services and APIs to develop apps on-premises
- **AWS Batch**
    - allows for processing large workloads in smaller chunks _(or batches)_
    - runs hundreds and thousands of smaller batch processing jobs
    - dynamically provisions instances based on volume

## Storage Services

### S3

- highly-available object storage service for cloud
- **objects** _(files)_ stored in **buckets** _(directories)_
- essentially unlimited storage _(can hold millions of objects per bucket)_
- objects can be public or private
- can upload objects via console, CLI, or from within code using SDKs
- can set security at bucket level or individual object level using access control lists _(ACLs)_, bucket policies, or access point policies
- can enable versioning to create multiple versions of file
- can use S3 access logs to track access to buckets and objects
- regional service but bucket names must be globally unique

#### S3 Storage Classes

- S3 Standard
- S3 Intelligent-Tiering
- S3 Standard-Infrequent Access _(IA)_
- S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access _(IA)_
- S3 Glacier
- S3 Glacier Deep Archive
- S3 Outposts

#### S3 in the Real World

- Static sites
- Data archive
- Analytics systems
- Mobile applications
    - users can upload files to S3 bucket and then leverage S3 Transfer Acceleration to make process _very_ fast

### EC2 Storage

- EC2 instances hosted on host computer _(or rack)_ in AWS data center
- these instances can be split up virtually into many EC2 instances
- all EC2 instances **must** have a root drive
    - could be EBS volume or instance store volume
    - EBS drives are persistent, while instance store drives are ephemeral

#### Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)

- storage device _(called a volume)_ that can be attached to (or removed from) your instance
- data persists when instance is not running
- can only be attached to one instance in same AZ
- tied to one AZ
- recommended for:
    - quickly accessible data
    - running a database on an instance
    - long-term data storage

#### EC2 Instance Store

- instance store is local storage that is physically attached to host computer and cannot be removed
- storage on disks physically attached to an instance
- storage is temporary since data loss occurs when EC2 instance is stopped
- faster with higher I/O speeds
- recommended for:
    - temporary storage needs
    - data replicated across multiple instances

#### Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)

- serverless network file system for sharing files
    - _think "Dropbox for your EC2 instances"_
- only supports Linux file system
- accessibility across different AZs in same Region
- more expensive than EBS
- recommended for:
    - main directories for business-critical apps
    - lift-and-shift existing enterprise apps

#### Storage Gateway

- hybrid storage service
- connect on-premises and cloud data
- recommended for:
    - moving backups to cloud
    - reducing costs for hybrid cloud storage
    - low latency access to data

#### AWS Backup

- integrates with resources like EC2, EBS, EFS, and more
- create backup plan that includes frequency and retention

## Content Delivery Services

- CDN is mechanism to deliver content quickly and efficiently based on geographic location

### [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)

- a CDN that delivers data and applications globally with low latency
- makes content available globally or restricts it based on location
- speeds up delivery of static and dynamic web content
- uses egde locations to cache content

**NOTE**: If content is already in the edge location, CloudFront delivers it immediately. Otherwise, CloudFront retrieves files from original source of content.

'CloudFront distribution' === collection of edge locations

#### CloudFront in the Real World

- S3 static websites
- Prevent attacks
    - can stop certain web attacks like DDoS
- IP address blocking

### [Amazon Global Accelerator](https://aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator)

- sends users through AWS global network when accessing content, thereby speeding up delivery
- improves latency and availability of single-Region applications
- sends traffic through AWS global network infrastructure
- 60% performance boost
- automatically re-routes traffic to healthy available regional endpoints

### [Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/transfer-acceleration/)

- improves content uploads and downloads to and from S3 buckets
- fast transfer of files over long distances
- customers around the world can upload to a central bucket
- uses CloudFront's globally distributed edge locations

## Networking Services

- connects computers together and allows for sharing of data and applications around the globe, in a secure manner using virtual routers, firewalls, and network management services

### [Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/)

- foundational service that allows you to create secure private network in AWS cloud where you launch your resources
- private virtual network
- isolate and protect resources
- launch resources like EC2 instances inside VPC
- VPC spans Availability Zones in a Region

_aside: "Internet Gateway" and "Peering Connection"_

- **Subnet**
    - allows you to split network inside the VPC
    - where you launch resources like EC2 instances
- **Network ACL**
    - access control lists ensure proper traffic is allowed into subnet
- **Router and Route Table**
    - defines where network traffic is routed
- **Internet Gateway**
    - allows public traffic to the internet from a VPC
- **VPC peering**
    - allows for connecting 2 VPCs together
    - facilitates transfer of data in secure manner
