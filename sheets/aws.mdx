## Benefits
_...of cloud computing_

1. High Availability
    - systems designed to operate continuously without failure for long time
    - avoid loss of service by managing or reducing errors
2. Elasticity
    - provision what you need, then shrink/grow based on demand
3. Agility
    - cloud services help innovate faster
4. Durability
    - long-term data protection

## Compute Services

### EC2

#### Pricing Options
- On-Demand
- Spot
- Reserved Instances
- Dedicated Hosts
- Savings Plans

#### Features
- **Elastic Load Balancing**: automatically distributes incoming app traffic across multiple EC2 instances
- **EC2 Auto Scaling**: adds or replaces EC2 instances automatically across AZs _(based on need and changing demand)_
    - _**NOTE** that this is horizontal scaling and **not** vertical scaling_
